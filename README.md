# TasteSENsation

TasteSENsation is a recipe site with curated recipes for budding chefs with Special Educational Needs (SEN).

Users are invited to sign up to rate and comment on the recipes so that other visitors to the site can see which recipes are popular. They can also suggest their own recipes to be added to the cookbook recipe list for others to enjoy.

The simple, uncluttered layout and use of additional visual prompts help to make the site easy to understand and navigate with minimal distractions. This means that SEN users are more likely to be able to use the site and follow the steps unaided.

## User Authentication

Users are required to sign up and log in to access certain functionality or areas of the TasteSENsation site.

Different user roles are able to view and access different parts of the site. 

***Casual User***

TasteSENsation recipes are intended to be accessible to all and some SEN users may not be able to easily provide the details required to register themselves.

Any visitor to the site who is not a registered user or not logged in can view the recipes list and the recipe detail pages so that they can enjoy making the recipe without having to register for the site. This includes viewing the average rating and approved comments, and filtering the recipes by the average rating.

Casual viewers are not able to:

- Rate a recipe
- Leave a comment
- View the Suggest Recipe page to submit a recipe to be added to the cookbook

***Admin SuperUser***

SuperUser login credentials are provided within the Code Institute project submission form.  
When logged in as a SuperUser, you are able to access the admin panel and create, read, update and delete any recipe or comment in the database.

When recipes are submitted via the Suggest Recipe page, these are added to the database, but are not visible in the recipe list until they have been 'Approved' in the admin dashboard. This is to ensure design continuity and simplicity in the curated recipes list for SEN users.

Submitted comments are added to the database for approval, and any unapproved comments are visible to the user who submitted the comment, but are not visible to other users until they have been approved in the admin dashboard. This is to ensure that any offensive or inappropriate comments are not visible to potentially vulnerable SEN users.
